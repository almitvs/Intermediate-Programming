To the best of my knowledge I followed the program specifications exactly. I decided to create a separate file for the help functions, of which there were two main functions corresponding to what I saw as the two main parts of the program: reading the text file and counting the graphs within it, then taking user queries. These two functions in the functions file called other functions to get the number of graphs, the graphs themselves, then count them in the text. I also had a function for converting everything to lower text. I chose to store graphs in a vector to easily sort them by ASCII order. I also used an unordered map to link graphs to lists of words they occur in in order to have constant time access. I created a vector of pairs with the graphs and number of occurences to be used in sorting for the frequency count printing option. I even made a comparator for that. For the user prompt I had a helper function to create a map of frequencies with the list of graphs that occur at that frequency. I also had one to check if a query is an integer. My program seems to run fast.
