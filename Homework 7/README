Justification:
I did not add any extra helper functions; I only implemented the functions define in the given CTree.h starter file. The logic of my functions should be self-explanatory of otherwise explained via the function and in-line comments. I will add a few quick notes here. In order to reuse code for similar functions I treated some functions as wrappers for others. For example, the overloaded + calls the addChild function, as does one of the other versions of the addChild function; the same is true with my implementation of the addSibling function. The addSibling functions are only used when a child needs to be added as a sibling of the node pointed to by kids of a given node. The overloaded == operator simply calls the treeCompare function. The treeCompare function, destructor, and toString all work recursively to execute their goals. The template Tree is almost exactly the same as the CTree except the toString function uses a stringstream when creating the string, otherwise if a regular string was used then numeric types would not be correctly added ()they would be added as the character corresponding to that ASCII value).
